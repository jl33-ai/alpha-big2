# Big2 AI Project - To-Do List

## Introduction
Replicating AlphaGoâ€™s AI methodology on a lesser card game: Big 2. Developing an AI to play the card game 'Big2', imitating AlphaGo techniques.

**The Revenge Motive:** <br>
> A friend, we'll call her Laura, introduces me to this new card game, Big 2 ðŸƒ’. <br>
> We play.<br>
> I win; 2-1<br>
> She insists that its just a game of chance; whoever is dealt the best hand<br>
> I promise to test this hypothesis<br>
> (By creating an entity which plays the game completely optimally, and thus, differentiate skill from luck.)

## Stages

### Stage 0: Preparation 
- Absorb Amanda's Repo and create tkinter GUI
- Create self-recorded explanatory video (And learn how to play the game) 

### Stage 1: Master the Game Rules
- **Objective**: Acquire a comprehensive understanding of 'Big2' rules and strategies.
- **Tasks**:
  - Study the rules and variations.
  - Research and analyze common strategies.

### Stage 2: Define the Game Environment
- **Objective**: Implement the fundamental game mechanics.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a class for the game environment.
  - Define methods for initializing, playing, and concluding the game.

### Stage 3: Design the State Representation
- **Objective**: Establish a systematic and efficient representation of the game state.
- **Tasks**:
  - Formulate the state representation.
  - Implement conversion functions between game state and machine-readable format.

### Stage 4: Create a Training Dataset (Optional)
- **Objective**: Generate a dataset for supervised learning.
- **Tasks**:
  - Collect gameplay data from experts or simulations.
  - Preprocess and structure the data for training.

### Stage 5: Build the Neural Network Model
- **Objective**: Develop the neural network for decision-making.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design and compile the neural network using TensorFlow.
  - Train the model using collected or simulated data.

### Stage 6: Implement Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- **Objective**: Integrate MCTS for optimal decision-making.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop an MCTS algorithm tailored for 'Big2'.
  - Interface it with the neural network.

### Stage 7: Develop Reinforcement Learning Training Loop
- **Objective**: Implement reinforcement learning for continuous improvement.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a training loop for self-play or competitive learning.
  - Monitor and fine-tune the learning process.

### Stage 8: Testing and Evaluation
- **Objective**: Assess the AI's performance and make necessary adjustments.
- **Tasks**:
  - Test against human or AI opponents.
  - Analyze performance and apply enhancements.

### Stage 9: Documentation and Showcase
- **Objective**: Document the project and showcase it on jl33.ai.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write detailed documentation.
  - Create engaging visuals and insights for Instagram showcase.
